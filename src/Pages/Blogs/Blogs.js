                            React applications, I am guaranteed a very fast UI by default. However, as an application grows, developers may encounter some performance issues.

                            In this guide, we will discuss five important ways to optimize the performance of a React application, including pre-optimization techniques.
                            Before optimizing a React application, we must understand how React updates its UI and how to measure an appâ€™s performance. This makes it easy to solve any React performance problems.

                            Unit tests are typically tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or period.                        </b>
